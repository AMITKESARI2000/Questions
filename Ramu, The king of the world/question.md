Ramu has set out on a journey to become the greatest King of all time. To get his win his first kingdom he went to sorcerer Karma. Since Ramu is a good person so the sorcerer karma wants him to be the King , So he gave him the ultimate spell to summon different creature to join his army.

But sorcerer Karma warns him that a group of k > 1 creatures with strengths {s1, s2, s3, ..., sk} tend to fight among each other if gcd(s1, s2, s3, ..., sk) = 1.

Ramu, being smart, does not want his Army to fight among each other. However, he also wants to maximize the number of Creatures he takes from the spell. Can you help Ramu find out the maximum number of Creatures he can take?

Note: A creature cannot fight with itself.
