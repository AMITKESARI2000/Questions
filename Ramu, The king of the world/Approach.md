Start going to every value given in array and find it's prime factors, 
for each prime factor increament it's count by 1,
(no need to consider different powers of that number as we only need to show the numbers have 1 common factor.)


use "map" data structure to have a check on different values values which are factors of the number.


find maximum element of the map.


(check code solution for better understanding),
