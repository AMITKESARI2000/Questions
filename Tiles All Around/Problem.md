The Institute wants to tile a grid of size Nx2 with rectangles (dominoes) of 2x1 (in either orientation).

Write a program that takes input N and outputs the number of different ways to tile the Nx2 grid.
Output the ans mod 10^9 + 7.

Input:
First line contains T (1 <= T <= 1000) - number of test case

Next T lines contains N (1 <= N <= 10^12 ) - height of grid

Output:
T lines containing a single value of ans mod 1000000007 in each line.
